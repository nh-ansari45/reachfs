            Designing garments according to changing consumer tastes and trends, getting these manufactured and delivered to retail outlets or to consumers directly is a complex task. That there are very many collections in a year, and that each collection has many garments, and the inability to deliver on time will lead to stock outs and mark downs makes this process a very complex, time sensitive one.
